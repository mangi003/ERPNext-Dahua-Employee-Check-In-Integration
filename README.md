# ERPNext-Dahua-Employee-Check-In-Integration
The Idea is to integrate Dahua time attendance device with ERPNext in the way that when employees Check In or Check Out the python script pulls the data of which rfid cart is it and when was the person checked and what was the status in or out and after that to go to ERPNext HR/Employee Checkin and push the data.
